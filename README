Description:
This JS script grabs all albums and displays them. When you click on an album it shows the photos in that album. If you click on a photo it brings up a lightbox. It is 100% jQuery. 

How to Use:
1) Create new facebook app. (https://developers.facebook.com/apps)
2) Make sure you include the lightbox js file and css file
3) Make sure you include the facebook JS SDK file
4) Make sure you include the Facebook_Photo_Gallery_Widget JS file
5) Include a div or any other html tag with the id "fb_gallery"
6) Set custom attribute app_id=""
7) Set custom attribute page_id=""


Notes:
- You get an app_id after you create a new app
- You can find the page id by visiting that page in your browser.

  - In the url above, the number at the end it the page_id. You can only use public pages, not peoples profiles.
- There is no CSS applied currently other than what the lightbox has applied.
